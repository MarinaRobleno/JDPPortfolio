  summary:
    "Since I was a child, I have been fascinated by the stories and adventures that the world of video games has offered me. So much so that, at a certain point, I decided to take a step forward and become a part of what excited me so much, in order to convey and share feelings and emotions with other gaming enthusiasts like myself. \n On a personal level, I consider myself a perfectionist, perseverant, and creative person. I am also very accustomed to working in teams, taking on responsibilities, and facing new challenges.",
